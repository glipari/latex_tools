A python script to transform a bib file into a html file.

The script is based on the *bibtexparser* library
[[https://bibtexparser.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/]], and it simply uses
the library to output some html in some consistent format. Please run
in on the example.bib to see out it works.

I also provide the css file that I use to output my paper list.
